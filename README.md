# Railway Operation Simulator Template Map 
A brief description of what the map represents, including era, whether the route is fictional and the level of difficulty.

*This repository should contain ultimately:

- An image of the route in BMP format within the `Images` folder
- The completed railway `.rly` file or if in development `.dev` file in the `Railway` folder.
- A complete timetable within the `Program_Timetables` folder 
- A session for the relevant timetable with preferred directions set.
- Documentation describing background to the route and operations tips within the `Documentation` folder. This can include any maps/useful information as well. The recommended format for the documentation is PDF to be universally accessible.
- Optionally a `Signal.hnd` file as a hint to what side signals are traditionally placed on the route.*
